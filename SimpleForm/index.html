                <b>Family Quotes</b><br>
                1.Family faces are magic mirrors looking at people who belong to us,
                we see the past, present, and future.
                2.The house does not rest upon the ground, but upon a woman.<br>
                 3. In family life, love is the oil that eases friction,
                  the cement that binds closer together, and the music that brings harmony.<br>
            4.A man should never neglect his family for business.
